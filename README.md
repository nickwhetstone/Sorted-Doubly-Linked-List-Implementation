# Sorted Doubly Linked List
This project is an implementation of a sorted doubly linked list using C++. It comes with a command line interface with user options for:

1. Creating a sorted doubly linked list with randomly generated numbers in nodes
2. Adding a specific number to the list
3. Deleting all nodes containing a particular number from the list
4. Printing the list in ascending order
5. Printing the list in descending order
6. Deleting all nodes and exiting the program
